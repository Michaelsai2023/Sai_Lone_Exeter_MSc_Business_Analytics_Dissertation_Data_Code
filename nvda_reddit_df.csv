"Everyone wants high end Nvidia chips‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs no supply chain problems like there were last year. Everyone is cranking on all cylinders to make them. Thing is, while there is a chance of oversupply in the future, that may be way ahead‚Ä¶ and by then, no one is going to want last-gen chips if the competition is going to buy up the newer, smarter, and faster chips. Therefore, revenue keeps going up. 

Even if Google, meta, etc make their own chips, they‚Äôre not selling to others. It‚Äôs for themselves. Therefore Nvidia will be able to sell to others to make up for what they won‚Äôt sell to Meta and Google. And Meta and Google are going to buy Nvidia chips anyway because they‚Äôll have to since they can‚Äôt just produce everything for themselves with the same kind of trusted quality of nvidia‚Äôs chips.",2023-05-29,4

"So if you think about it, if you just picked random things. Markets typically move up and even by chance day today let's just say there's a 50/50 chance it's going to go up or down. So how do over 90% of retail traders lose money? 

Oh that's right people listen to the news, financial advice from the ""professionals"" ü§£

As someone who eventually became a profitable trader, there's two things I'll share that really help. The first one is you have to think about Wall Street like a giant game of liars poker. You don't really know if people are giving you decent advice or if they are just trying to manipulate you for their own means which more times than not is what's going on. The second one is if you watch the movements of the markets long enough you begin to anticipate what's going to happen. 

At no point have I ever found financial news helpful in what they are saying. It's also worth noting a lot of the financial YouTube channels are literally paid to promote various things and steer the audience in the direction the paid promoter wants them to go",2023-05-30,1

Another time I invested in Amd when it was $5 it was going up and then it crashed and a coworker told me yeah just sell it it never goes higher than $50. Well I sold it and a day later it hit $120.

He doesn't say ride this biatch into the ground..... If you do lose a couple of percent you should know you got to get out.  Likewise, he tells you if you make a gain to take something off the table. Of course with some stocks you're leaving good money on the table, so be it.

In any case, Investors and fund managers alike carefully consider various financial indicators and financial models when making investment decisions (Yes even for your 401k or when balancing a portfolio for Vanguard.)

"The primary reason why gaming GPUs aren't used has very little to do with scalability.  It  is because the NVDA EULA specifically *prohibits* gaming cards being used in commercial datacentres. \[This is ignored by some budget cloud providers who simply act as a market for individuals selling GPU access.\]

NVDA has huge problem because they offer CUDA support on all models. They have also merged the RTX and workstation drivers. This means gaming GPU  cannibalise enterprise sales because they offer 3-5x better cost/performance than enterprise GPUs. The only 'defence' NVDA has is crippling RAM and data bandwidth. \[The latest NVDA mid-tier gamings cards are  very mediocre as a result. \]

NVDA also bans the production of RTX 4090 blower type GPUs which can be used in rack servers and workstation \[Unbranded models are readily available on the Asian grey market.\]

The latest NVDA scam is restricting VRAM to ludicrously low levels (eg 8GB) to stop discourage cheap RTX cards, like the 4070, being used being used for ML and workstation use.

"Nvidia has deeper expertise?  Since when?  It's hilarious watching wallstreetbets talk about this stuff, blissfully unaware of anything that happens in the industry.  If they knew anything about this stuff they would have been saying what they're saying now at least ten years ago.  CUDA is from 2007.  AMD has had a different approach to their long term planning around compute, heading towards heterogeneous compute (e.g. old 2013 article: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-closer-look-at-amds-heterogeneous-computing/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-closer-look-at-amds-heterogeneous-computing/)).  While I still agree that CUDA is a moat, it's a stream now while 10 years ago it was the Nile.  If someone wanted to be forward-looking today, they might be looking at SYCL and other accelerators than just GPUs.  Even though those may also use CUDA, the key factor is how easy it is to offload compute to other units, whether they're OpenCL GPUs or Xilinx (AMD) FPGAs, or anything else.  

When it comes to raw hardware performance, AMD doesn't have that much of an issue trading blows with Nvidia if it wants to, but what is the point of putting out a high priced card at performance parity when most will buy the Nvidia card for Cuda anyway, especially in that high end part of the market.  AMD will need to breach that moat first if it wants to compete with high end hardware.

Take two companies, sized 750 and 250 and to keep things simple let us assume they are the only ones in the index.  When 100 dollars are invested in the index, 75 goes to the 750 and 25 to the 250, so their relative sizes don't change.  750/250 = 3, 825/275 = 3.

"Correct, SYCL is not itself a hardware accelerator, it is an abstraction layer for C++ code to run on a wide variety of hardware accelerators including the standard CUDA GPUs, but also OpenCL GPUs, Xilinx FGPAs, and more.  Also to run on large sets of CPUs with OpenMP.  

If it works out well... the idea is that you can write once for SYCL and run everywhere with at least decent accelerator utilization rather than writing just for CUDA and having something just run on just Nvidia GPUs.",2023-07-05,2

"The keyword there is ""more"".  While they are less specialized than they used to be, and much code has been rearranged to take advantage of how they are, that doesn't mean they are general compute.  Almost definitionally they wouldn't really be GPUs anymore then, they would have morphed back into being CPUs.  I'm very well aware of how computing on GPUs happens, it's pretty much all geared at linear algebra and doing lots of the same thing to a bunch of numbers, this is what the compute kernel typically is.  If you want to do lots of different things to those numbers rather than the same thing, well... you probably don't want to use a GPU.  

Yes, streaming multiprocessors allow execution of more than one kernel on the GPU, but it is still in pretty big chunks.

>3.2.8.2. Concurrent Kernel Execution  
>  
>Some devices of compute capability 2.x and higher can execute  multiple kernels concurrently. Applications may query this capability by  checking the concurrentKernels  
 device property (see [Device Enumeration](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#device-enumeration)), which is equal to 1 for devices that support it.  
>  
>The maximum number of kernel launches that a device can execute concurrently depends on its compute capability and is listed in [Table 15](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#features-and-technical-specifications-technical-specifications-per-compute-capability).  
>  
>A kernel from one CUDA context cannot execute concurrently with a  kernel from another CUDA context. The GPU may time slice to provide  forward progress to each context. If a user wants to run kernels from  multiple process simultaneously on the SM, one must enable MPS.  
>  
>Kernels that use many textures or a large amount of local memory are less likely to execute concurrently with other kernels.

[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)

The maximum for the Compute Capability 9.0 is 128 according to the referenced table 15.  As you can also see from that table, there are many other constraints.  Along with needing to do a lot of the same thing, there is also a pretty significant cost for the data shuffling to offload to a GPU or any other accelerator.  To make good use of these automatically, you need a system that is good at predicting how long any given process well be running, i.e. will it be worth the overhead to offload or is it better to just execute on CPU.",2023-07-05,1

It's also a poor indicator for highly speculative companies, e.g. startups and battery companies, but for large companies dramatic increases (10x over the course of 1-3 years) in revenue shouldn't be expected. I think it's a fair indicator to use for a company like Nvidia. If they went 7x on revenue and earnings without changing stock price they'd be right in the ballpark with the rest of big tech. It's certainly possible, but it took them over ten years to go 7x to get to their revenue peak last year. The next 7x growth is going to be even harder.

P/S can also be viewed as a ceiling on P/E (though not quite thanks to accounting shenanigans). Like if Nvidia could make all their revenue without paying a penny for it, they'd still have a P/E of around 39, which is still higher than Apple, GOOG, and MSFT.",2023-08-14,2

as someone who works intimately with large scale clients and companies that do buy these chips ... the speed per price ratio isn't going to get better. they'll price upwards and the oversupply chips will get cheaper (already starting to). AI hype will simmer (will be years for a lot of these companies to revamp their companies with this new tech).

"This transaction is attributed to a 10b5-1 plan established in March. 

Much like retail clients may set up recurring transactions to buy a predetermined amount of stock on a periodic basis, say weekly/biweekly/monthly. 

You can think of these plans similar to setting a recurring sell transaction on a periodic basis. A example use-case could be: an employee wants to diversify their restricted stock units on a rolling basis as they vest. The employee could establish this plan and have a transaction to automatically sell incoming RSU‚Äôs, receiving the proceeds as cash.

After a 10b5-1 plan is established participants are subject to a cooling-off period before they take effect, normally 90 days. This is to curb potential insider trading during restricted periods, and acts as a preventative measure against such accusations for the duration of the plan. 

Since plan participants cannot modify the schedule once the plan is established, cannot cancel without incurring another cooling off period, or transact (both buy or sell) with said stock outside the plan during it‚Äôs duration.

This transaction was both disclosed and well telegraphed several months ago. This is just the first periodic occurrence after the cooling off period ended.",2023-09-09,11

"That couldn't be more false.

Cramer was actually screaming ""sell all stocks"" for months before that, and then, like now, fools mocked him for it.

His past performance was public and you could look it up.  To say he outperformed would be a huge understatement.  Over 14 years he averaged 27% *after* fees.  Since leaving the industry, his charity trust holdings have also been public, and they've radically outperformed.  

What's interesting is that a big part of his results have come from several key juncture in which he sold everything to cash at opportune times.  2008 was me such time.  He was also first and alone in screaming for people to sell all prior to COVID.  

You don't have to like or follow him.  But continuing to regurgitate falsehoods about him doesn't do anything for your portfolio or your credibility.",2023-11-14,1

"AMD has their MI300X/MI300A coming out in the next year. I'm sure Intel is working on something. Maybe even ARM is as well. And then you have Tesla producing their own ML chips for Grok and FSD.

We don't know the extent of how much demand there is for these chips. For now, there is enough demand to buy up whatever is produced. But keep in mind this isn't crypto. With crypto, the demand was near infinite because the chips made money directly. With ""AI"", at least for now, OpenAI had to spend $100MM to train GPT4. Not many companies can do that. GPT4 is amazing, but I definitely run into its limitations a lot. How much do we have to spend with current technology to get something better? Spending $1B on training a model won't scale performance linearly. It might only come out 4% more accurate.

At the moment OpenAI seems to be the only company with the secret sauce. There are other LLMs that are promising but don't come near GPT3.5/4/etc. The longevity of this market entirely depends on everyone else being able to commercialize their own LLMs. And currently, everything outside of OpenAI comes up short.",2023-11-14,2

3. DITM options have early assignment risk, which can force you to buy or sell the underlying shares. You need significant liquidity available to offset this, as well as being forced to reset your basis. See tax implications above.

You technically are buying the right to have the same exposure to the stocks.

"> she‚Äôs betting it‚Äôll go that low so she can buy at that price

I think the fix to your understanding, based on this comment, is this: a call option means you can buy at the strike price (in this case $120) on or before the expiration date, *no matter what price the stock is at*. So if I buy a call with a strike price of $100 and then the stock goes from $101 to $110, I‚Äôve made $10/share because I can buy a $110 stock at a discounted price of $100. That‚Äôs why call options can have *intrinsic value*, or value that you get by exercising the option. But, like the name implies, it‚Äôs your option - your choice. If the stock goes below $100, the owner of a call option doesn‚Äôt *have* to buy the stock at $100, and they wouldn‚Äôt because they could buy it on the open market for less than $100.

When it‚Äôs a put option, it‚Äôs the other way around because a put represents the right to sell. I might buy a $100 strike put, then the stock goes to $90, and I buy the stock on the market at $90 so I can then use my put sell it at $100 for an immediate $10 profit. 

With options, the goal is still ‚Äúbuy low, sell high,‚Äù but it‚Äôs ‚Äúbuy low, sell high‚Äù in a different way. Essentially, a call is always a bet that the stock will go up, and a put is always a bet that the stock will go down.",2023-12-22,3

"I feel like I'm also missing something because why wouldn't everyone do this all the time? I get that it puts you into a leveraged situation, but you're assuming NVDA doesn't lose roughly 75% of its current value in the next 12 months which seems like an insanely safe bet, no? 

Say the value doesn't move at all for the next year; you could pick up those stocks at $120/share for a stock that's $490/share?",2023-12-22,1

"You can get a 2-3 bedroom for under 2k per month in a suburban town in the Midwest according to apartment finder and Zillow, which is less than 24k a year.

Her husband is a VC and RE developer. He made the money and makes most of these trades. It‚Äôs not a conspiracy,2023-12-22,2
I would also be a millionaire with that salary.,2023-12-22,5
Well they are able to act on what they hear behind closed doors so they get to move before the market. On top of that they get ~~bribes~~ money from lobbyists.,2023-12-22,2
"It would not be hard at all for anyone earning that to be a millionaire by the time they are 80.
Almost hard NOT TO be",2023-12-22,2
Many married into money or had it to start,2023-12-22,2
It's really not surprising to be a millionaire after decades of making 200k,2023-12-22,3
"It's easy to be a millionaire when you're 80 making 180k for the last 40 years. Even if you invested only 50k of that 180k and got the 10% average returns you'd have over 25 million dollars. 

Add in the fact that at 180k it's pretty easy to save way more than 50k. (my partner and I make about 175k combined and invest almost 80k a year from that which would bring that up to 43 million).

Keep in mind that's with a market average 10% return. If you were able to be in the room where policy decisions were made and make trades before that knowledge was public information you should be able to easily blow away the 10% average. If you just got a 10% return the first 20 years then with your seniority and being in committees that open you up to information you got a 17% return the next 20 years you would have 104 million dollars. Note that Nancy has a net worth around 115 million. 

When you understand all of that it becomes pretty easy to see how someone who ""only"" makes 180k could have a 9 figure net worth with little to no super nefarious behavior(like being paid off by foreign states).",2023-12-22,88
"I thought so at first but the description is ‚Äúcall options.‚Äù When it says transaction type P, I think that means personal. As in the calls are owned by her",2023-12-22,1
"most of the are already millionaires when they run for office, thats why calls to cut their salary are so fucking dumb, it empowers the ones who already make millions by being in bed with corporate power, and makes it very difficult for young congresspeople who want to support their staff",2023-12-22,15
She can just‚Ä¶buy them.,2023-12-22,6
"By paying a high premium. Basically she can control actual shares without owning them. Access to the gains without as high of an initial investment.

It‚Äôs all insider trading my dude,2023-12-22,1
Interesting. I've never heard of buying significantly in the money calls like that. Why not just use leverage and buy the shares outright at that point?,2023-12-22,11
Right...?,2023-12-22,4
Believe what you want.  But your blanket statement is just projecting a false narrative.,2023-12-22,0
"As commenter above said, they'd control many more shares this way. Still, the premiums are huge so it's above my smoothbrain understanding",2023-12-22,13
It mostly is for the purpose of leverage but not everyone has access to 5x leverage. Also with calls you will never be margin called and forced to liquidate,2023-12-22,7
"Maybe that‚Äôs their original cost basis? NVDA ended 2022 at 146.14. 

After holding a year, the writer gets to lock in a fat premium and defer the long term capital gain to tax year 2024. They get the gain upfront and then $120/share in December 2024 which can be used to pay the tax due 4 months later.",2023-12-22,7
"Yeah, about $37,000 per 100 shares sold",2023-12-22,1
"Call options are a *right to buy* a stock. You‚Äôre paying a premium in advance for the possibility of buying the stock at a certain price.

If I am paying for a chance to buy a stock at a given price, my *right to buy* is worth more the more a stock goes up. So just because the strike price is $120 doesn‚Äôt mean this is a bet for the stock to go to $120.

If this was a put option, that would be a *right to sell*, meaning that a $120 put would be a bet that the stock goes below $120, because you wouldn‚Äôt sell at that price unless it went below that price.",2023-12-22,29
"It's a bet that Nvidia will trade at $120 plus the the cost of options, which it's about $375 as I write this. She bought 50 contracts, which are 100 shares each, for about $1.9M instead of buying 5000 shares directly for about $2.5M. There's more volatility in the option prices, but you get ability to play with more shares for the same amount of money.",2023-12-22,1
It's a common way to take on a leveraged long position. You control way more shares with a smaller capital outlay.,2023-12-22,2
"Um, I don't see how him being a drunk driver adds to his wealth though. If anything, it subtracts from his wealth.",2023-12-22,-2
I dunno. Nvidia is at like 480 now so 120 might be an OTM strike price. The higher it goes the more that option is worth. Especially with a strike date that far out,2023-12-22,1
That's pretty clearly outlined by having access to information before it's public.,2023-12-22,13
I'm not saying there's no bad apples or that most of them aren't doing nefarious I'm just saying that there is a path to that kind of insane wealth through normal -ish means with that kind of salary for that long.,2023-12-22,2
Live well below your means,2023-12-22,8
"That's 175k combined gross. We end up having about 102k hit our bank (though as outlined below a lot of the 80k is already taken out by that point.)

We both max our 401k and hsa and have a match on our 401k that makes all that about 60k. Then we both have Roth IRAs and put some in a personal brokerage account. 

The big things are that we bought a home well before what we could ""afford."" We both drive cars that have been paid off for 5+ years (a Toyota and a Honda). And we eat 80% of our meals at home. And we have already built up an emergency fund of 9 months expenses. 

We also are diligent to not get sucked in by ads or ""sales"" for stuff we were never going to buy to begin with just because ""it's a good deal.""

We still certainly have a good deal we could trim if we wanted. We spend a lot of travel during our PTO. I also am a fantasy football fanatic so I didn't 1500 on best ball entries this year. So I'm not trying to act like we are better or worse than anyone else. Just outlining how we invest 80k per year with 175k gross income.",2023-12-22,2

With rates going down, it will be easier for individual companies to raise capital and make use of their products and services.

"Hedge funds- market makers- usually sell those deep ITM call options. They collect premium from selling the calls, and usually have an offsetting position to hedge the sale of these calls.

It does not necessarily mean NVDA is going to tank- that is possible, but they run numerous different strategies simultaneously which profit no matter which way the stock moves, even if it does tank. 

For this strategy they would likely have an offsetting long stock/call option position, potentially hedged with an accompanying put strategy as well- in this case it would likely be selling puts, in combination with long calls/stock on top of the calls sold to Pelosi. They could also be using other types of derivatives, such as swaps; it could be simple in that they just sell the deep ITM calls and buy long calls with a very tiny margin of profit, which doesn't matter if they're selling hundreds of thousands or millions of these options and are able to heavily influence the movement of the stock themselves. 

Selling calls like this allows them to collect very high premium, while mitigating their risk against their own positions. They may not even have a long stock position on NVDA, they could sell these calls against their own long calls. 

I'm repeating myself and rambling, but I hope that explains some of it. It is likely that the hedge fund which sold her these calls doesn't care and is unaffected by the direction of price movement, and yes they may think/know it is going to tank, but this alone would not indicate that for certain.",2023-12-23,12

"The deep ITM long calls will already be offered by the market maker, Pelosi will just place an order via her brokerage and the market maker will sell her the calls; they do it because it benefits them, and being a market maker, they are somewhat obligated to provide liquidity to those options.

To your last sentence- yeah pretty much, they offer it and she says YOLO I'll take it, and they hedge around it after the fact/simultaneously, or have pre-existing hedges in place already. 

It is convoluted and it is complicated, but when it comes down to it the math makes sense, it's just impossible to know their exact positions in real time in order to see exactly what their angle is in selling the deep ITM calls, but it can be safely assumed they have ensured they won't be affected much or at all if the stock price goes higher rapidly, which is the purpose of the hedges. There are numerous possibilities from both Pelosi and the market maker's perspectives, but until the stock does make its move and/or their positions are made public (many are never made public though), it is pretty much impossible to tell if she actually knows something or is making a massive reckless gamble.",2023-12-23,1

Now, Nancy comes along. She believes the price of SuperCar won't go down to $5. So, she makes a deal with the market makers. She agrees to buy SuperCars at $8 each (this is like buying ""calls"" at a ""strike price"" of $8). She thinks she can sell them later for more than $8.

The market makers are okay with this because they are getting a good deal too. They think the price of SuperCar might go down, and if it does, they can sell it to Nancy for $8, even if it's worth only $5 in the market. This way, they don't lose as much money.

But if the price of SuperCar doesn't go down, and stays at $10 or goes higher, Nancy can buy SuperCars for $8 from the market makers and sell them for more. She makes a profit!

So, Nancy's deal is a kind of bet. She's betting that the price of SuperCar won't go down a lot. The market makers are taking the opposite bet. They think the price might go down, so they're happy to have a plan (selling to Nancy at $8) in case it does.

The chart since May 2023 looks pretty volatile- a lot of uncertainty. With a lot of recent market moves we've seen the media say one thing, and stock market/single securities do the opposite shortly afterward. I'm wondering if this could be an attempt at creating a bull trap. 

If China goes for Taiwan in any way, NVDA should skyrocket given TSMC's production would have to be offset, but simultaneously, depending on exactly what happens and how, could also have a negative effect on NVDA if it is unable to procure raw materials, semiconductors which it does not produce itself, or some other aspect I'm not thinking of, as I'm not an expert in semiconductors.

"""With so many legislators going back and forth, what kind of places do they call home when they‚Äôre in Washington?

Congressional offices.  In recent years, dozens of members including former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) have opted to live rent-free in their offices, opting to sleep on sofas or foldable mattresses.  While supporters say office living allows them to focus on their work and ignore the distractions of Washington, DC, detractors say the practice unfairly uses taxpayer-funded housekeeping services.  Members who live in their offices are most likely to travel frequently between Washington and their state/district.
Group homes or apartments.  Renting a room in a DC rowhouse or apartment isn‚Äôt only popular with staffers ‚Äì members of Congress do it, too.  Similar to congressional offices, apartments are popular with members who travel routinely to and from Washington.  Echoing back to the days where lawmakers lived in boarding homes, some members opt for a group-home style set-up.  A notable example of this is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and former Rep. George Miller (D-CA), who shared a Capitol Hill rowhome until 2014.
Property ownership in the DC area.  A smaller portion of Senators and Representatives reside on property they own in the Washington, DC area.  This can range from condominiums or rowhomes in the District to single family homes in the suburban communities of Maryland and northern Virginia.  Members in this category generally do not travel as frequently to their home district or state as their fellow legislators, and some even raise their families in the DC area.  Examples of current lawmakers who relocated their families to the DC area following their election to Congress include Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-TX).  A notable exception within this group is lawmakers from Maryland, Virginia, and other jurisdictions in the Mid-Atlantic who already reside withing commuting distance of Washington.""

Nvidia has been either good or lucky over the years.

When 3D got hot, they were able to sell video cards for 5-10x the going rate.  Then when there was a console war, they got to overcharge for those chips.

Then when physics engines were hot, cha-Ching.

The AR moves prices to a silly level.

As those were cooling off, along comes crypto.  Suddenly price was based on the concept of what a miner could make with the chips, with no rational mooring to what they might be worth or what they might cost.

When that was levelling off, GPU's got their place in the sick margin spotlight.  

Then more crypto.  

Then auto.  Then self driving.  

And when it seemed like the dream might actually be running its course for them, along comes AI.  They're selling spoonfuls of sand for $10-$15k.  

Maybe it's that they keep getting lucky, or maybe they're just good.  But the share price doesn't care which it has been.",2024-01-09,6

"The issue is that he shorted nVidia. He didn't just invest in good stable companies. That would be reasonable if he did. He actively shorted growth stocks. Back of the envelope estimates state that he's down $5million on that short and in his videos he's acknowledged drama in the family since he used his extended families money to do this.

So it's not about looking for good stable companies.

Nvidia is both lucky and VERY GOOD. They literally have a monopoly on their CUDA software system and their GPU's are still quite superior to AMD's best efforts.

I love AMD as a company, but they're several country miles behind NVDA. In the software world with CUDA, they're 100's of miles behind. NVDA might have the largest moat in the world right now, with the most valuable product in the world. Why wouldn't they be worth 2.5 trillion?",2024-01-09,23

This is why Pelosi is against a bill, a LAW that prevents what amounts to insider trading. If you don't think that's corrupt, are you so naive to think that the oversight and influence these pols wield doesnt also go in the opposite direction of favoring and tipping the scales towards corporations and interests that have influence over them? Do you think it wasn't corrupt for Trump to use his DC hotel to enrich himself as a mid-tier pay to play scam? It happened in plain site but was corrupt AF

"We agree on the last part.

Her and centrist Dems are *plenty* guilty of pushing forth anti-progressive measures like pay-go and relentlessly thwarting things like the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Supreme Court Reform ideas, a Wealth Tax while supporting our belligerent Middle East policies.

Pelosi isn't some fighter for the people. The only reason Republicans hate her so much is because she is an effective Democratic operative. And they just hate Democrats no matter what. Look at the very conservative Border Bill Dems and Biden were trying to pass. Now the Repubs hate it LOL. Their hatred for her is not because they can't stand her politics. When she helped pass Obamacare, the big joke was that this was a plan cooked up by the Heritage Foundation and first championed by Mitt Romney for fucks sake.

"> Definitely not her husband buying millions of dollars worth of Nvidia stock prior to the vote on the CHIPS act in July 2022.

CHIPS act was public legislation and so was the text. Anyone could have bought tech stocks days before the vote, which was expected to pass. NVDA isn't mentioned at all in the legislation.

> Nvidia partnering with the US Government for AI research back in late 2023/early 2024

It is a $35M partnership on providing tools and services. Not a Market Maker and not even a blip on the radar. Also, it was the result of an Executive Order by President Biden - not Congress.

"I only read from people who buy options on NVDA these days. Seems to me it's become a tool for speculation and gambling first and foremost. At this point there's no justification for the price of NVDA's stock without fantasising. AI has to turn the world upside down fast and NVDA has to stay on top for the foreseeable time, those are the basic premises to even start making sense of its valuation.¬†

"I think anyone looking to buy at the current price, using future earnings to justify, is a clown. A supply shortage is always followed by a supply glut. NVDA have competitors in the space, they are not a monopoly. It‚Äôs a squeeze, and it will end. AI is a poor justification for saying that won‚Äôt happen. Demand doesn‚Äôt grow forever. Chips continue to be working chips for many years. AI tech seems 5-10 years from actually making the big bucks, much like the tech bubble in 2000 was 10 years too early. If you want AI, GOOG is the value play. Return on capital invested 20+, PE close to 20 and a giant moat around loads of different ventures , it‚Äôs a reasonable buy even at current prices.",2024-02-18,18
"Nobody here is actually talking about what $NVDA brings to the table so let me shed some light. 

Nvidia has a huge moat technology-wise. CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary GPU programming framework is ubiquitous for deep learning. As such, Nvidia's GPUs are genuinely the only ones used in the space (for all intensive purposes).

As a software engineer, I can tell you that this has been the case for nearly a decade and this boom in valuation was highly predictable.",2024-02-18,4

"But the adage ""buy it because its been at that price before"" seems slightly concerning... Do you actually know why it may go back to previous heights or is your philosophy behind it just that weak understanding?",2024-02-18,6
"Pros:
1. Insane growth. With a trailing pe of 96 but a fed pe of 36. Revenue and EPS up well over 100% yoy.
2. Strong moat with CUDA and high end GPUs. CUDA is the real secret sauce and moat though. The entire industry is used to using CUDA to accelerate compute of their models. 
3. Quality of the customers. NVDAs customers have the deepest pockets in the world. I don‚Äôt see their appetite for GPUs slowing down anytime soon. 
4. Pricing power. The chip demand is so high that the fabs can‚Äôt keep up. It takes billions of dollars and years to bring up a new fab and get these chips churning. Meantime NVDA basically has its customers by the balls. 

Cons:
1. AI bust. Generative AI could turn out to be unprofitable which would decrease investment.
2. Competition. AMD or others release competitive GPU offerings at a more reasonable price.
3. Someone manages to get CUDA to run efficiently on AMD hardware.

5. Unpredictable macro headwinds. Shit happens. What if China invaded Taiwan? What if there is a major recession? NVDA price would be annihilated if something like that occurred. 
6. Unsustainable profit margins. It‚Äôs unlikely that they will maintain these margins for years to come. You can double the demand but if you cut the margins in half, you come out at the same amount of profit. Their margins are insane and are likely to decrease in the future.

NVDA, meta, GOOGL, and many other growth names have traded at great value recently. For me, mid 20s PE or below (assuming strong balance sheet like under 35% debt/equity) for any company projecting over 15%+ forward puts it into good ‚Äúvalue‚Äù territory. 

I like PEG if it‚Äôs way under 1 at almost any growth rate.

In fact, id rather invest in a 20% grower priced for declining revenue growth than a slow grower priced for declining revenue.

"Predicting where any company will be 10 years in the future isn't an easy task. Mixed feelings but in my opinion NVDA is overvalued. Very overvalued. Let's run some quick numbers (Warren Buffet way...)...

NVDA's EPS TTM is $8/share.  
Earnings growth of the last years is averaging around 35%. 

We could assume that PE will be around 40, as that is the average for the tech companies in the long run.

Now, let's apply **common sense.** ***NVDA will not grow 35% forever. NVDA is a hardware company, that is, hardware is generally a single purchase that is used until replacement or an upgrade is needed.*** How can I assume this revenue is not cyclical? **I can't**

So I can assume that it will not keep growing at 35%, maybe 15% or even 20% if I am veeery optimistic.

Let's grow the EPS by 20% for 10 years, that is 50. With a PE of 40 that makes one NVDA stock around $1980 a share. My minimum acceptable return is 15%, if I now discount at this rate, it makes my current value of one NVDA share to be $490. And if I apply a margin of safety to my valuation it makes it 250$ a share (the whole point of this entire subreddit), which is waaay lower than current price at around 725$.

Yes, that's been the promise for some time.   But I question why those incentives are any different than a year or two or 3 years ago?   Rocm was announced in 2014, they've had dozens of releases already.  Are you under some impression customers more motivated today than they were last year with MI250?    The first public chatGPT release was Nov22 for example.

The pieces that a lot of folks don't understand are:  1) software optimization really matters and 2) Nvidia has a deep product stack.   Nvidia will not be fighting MI300 with H100.  MI300 is rumored to be priced at $10-15K, or something on the order of 1/3-1/4 the cost of H100.  Why do you think AMD priced it like that?   

Honestly they wouldn't have to if it was in the same performance league as H100.   

But it means Nvidia will not be battling with H100, they'll be positioning MI300 against the nearly 4 year old A100.",2024-02-19,2

"Not sure where you get that data, 

I know people who are building data center and they say that all big players are paying out of their asses to get as many GPUs from NVIDIA as they can and dedicate a significant portion of the budget of data center to AI.

Still, I too think that the current valuation of NVIDIA is nuts and we definitely are in a giant ass bubble, but the timing might be off a few years from now.",2024-02-19,1
"They‚Äôre not interchangeable on all workloads but they could be on parity on certain workload and that‚Äôs enough for some customers provided the price is right. But inferior versatility means MI300X needs to be priced lower. ¬†¬†


The rumored 10k to 15k price of MI300X is what Microsoft gets in exchange for helping on the ROCm software stack. The price for other customers should be higher. ¬†¬†


¬†Nvidia also has the reputation of proven solution and such a status commands a premium in enterprise market. Xeon provides inferior price to performance compared to EPYC for a long time and still manages to hold on to majority market share.


You also need to consider that MI300 is a lot closer to H100 compared to MI250x to A100 in terms of hardware capability and AI demand wasn‚Äôt so high in the MI250x days. Companies pours much more resources into Nvidia alternatives than before.",2024-02-19,2
"""When asked about the current attach rate of GPUs on servers, neither Kress nor Nvidia co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang gave a direct answer.

You know this how?   

There is zero public benchmark info, only AMD's paper launch.

"Looking at earnings expectations, the price isn't actually as crazy as I had assumed. That said, just about everything positive is already baked into the stock price, so buying today leaves no margin of safety, and even perfect execution by the company will result in middling returns at best.

Mi300x and h100 are so specialized towards compute and matrix workloads that they definitely are proxy to asics. Its not like going from a cpu to an asic that can yield 10x performance. We are talking like maybe going from an h100 to a very specialized asic for a very specific model might see a 1.5-2.0x performance gain. And you lose nearly 100% of the versatility.,2024-02-19,2

"INTC has some incredible tailwinds, being the only American foundry company that is capable of producing at large scale and capable of producing advanced chips. The CHIPS Act is already giving them more than $10B and that is the beginning of one of the most critical companies to US national security, far moreso than any traditional aerospace/defense company. 

As this 'Cold War' between the US and China grows primarily because of semiconductors and one of only 3 global companies that run mass semiconductor foundries, let alone ones with the ability to make advanced chips. The other two are in Taiwan, which China continues to assert it will invade, and South Korea, which is geopolitically vulnerable given its local neighborhood. 

The US is fine with some critical parts of the semiconductor chain being monopolized by close allies, like the Netherlands' ASML, but foundries are more important than the ability to produce anything else as the Western World does not have the ability to meet anything close to the demand for semiconductors without TSMC *and* Samsung. Intel, however, is capable of scaling up and could eventually become one of the highest market cap companies in the world. I lean towards it succeeding - not because of the seemingly unending bad management, but because it is an existential crisis for the US if it fails.",2024-02-19,1

"The question is for how long? 

For the past 8 years nobody cared for gpus but gamers. Now every tech giant wants them. Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Intel and AMD and Alibaba/Tencent/Baidu are all going to try to destroy CUDA starting just now. 8 years ago they couldn't care. 

These companies, especially the first 4, have 50-100bn in cash each. If they think they will spend 10-20bn a year on Nvidia gpus a year going forward and can get them for 5bn if they destroy CUDA then it makes more than sense to throw billions each into trying to do so.

Nvidia is the only company benefitting from the industry using CUDA in the long run. Their margins are insane. If these companies make their own GPUs with open-source software they will save billions.

I cant say how long it will take them but in the long run I would rather put my money on all these tech giants vs 1. 

I think whats also important to note is that, its way easier for a company to enjoy its moat long term when their costumers are consumers. How are consumers gonna destroy CUDA because they had to pay huge markups for Nvidia gpus for their gaming pc? This goes for so many more companies that enjoy a moat thats targeting consumers.

But if a company has a moat that makes big companies pay huge markups, you better believe the big companies are coming for them. 

They said it was impossible to run MacOS or windows or ARM architecture a couple years ago. But these companies got big enough to make it worth their investments. Now they both run almost perfectly on ARM and thats with Microsoft not even making that much on it. For Apple it was worth their while. Not needing to pay Intel their huge markups anymore. Only half of that to ARM and designing the rest themselves.",2024-02-22,3

100x bigger huh?  so $10B x 100 = $1T.   Between what 6 hyperscalers?  Any CEO can look at that math and decide $20B a year on GPUs is cheaper than 167B on a new architecture?   .

True, but it was only 8 years ago.   But what do you think it's based on?  Surely not their legacy x86 CPUs?   No they're up because they're riding Jensen's coat tails.

>just started serious investments in data center GPUs for what 2 years now. 

False.  The Instinct product line was introduced in 2017, following Nvidia's lead with P100 that was introduced in 2016.

I have also been watching NVDA daily just incase it fails to $650 again, I feel comfortable selling completely there. 

-Verizon is a dud stock to me. I got yield trapped at an earlier age and I didn't understand a lot about investing. My monkey brain definitely just saw a high dividend yield.

You don't seem to understand my point. The point was that AMD had barely any capital for the past 8 years compared what they are having now.

Again, you seem to entirely miss the point. I said they just starting investing serious sums. I didn't say they didn't invest anything in it. You seem to be raging so fast that all you can think of is how you can tell me i'm wrong. We are both here to learn. Relax, read, reply.  


>False. By unit volume, Intel is the largest supplier of GPUs in the world and have been for many years.

You are literally wasting both our time at this point. I explained to you how Intel barely made any investments for years, which is a well known story in the industry and the reason why they are a smaller company than AMD now which they used to own completely, and your counter argument is ''they sell more GPUs by volume than any one else''? This has nothing to do with my argument, once again. How does this argue with my argument that Intel barely made any investments for many many years? Because they sold some floppy integrated GPUs in 300$ laptops? 90% of these GPUs sales are worthless integrated GPUs in cheap laptops and desktops. How does that argues they didn't make any investments for years?  


>If you didn't notice today, Nvidia earnings lifted world wide stock markets (Europe and Asia) with new highs on S&P and Dow with multihundred point gains. Nvidia did that and added $250B (more than NFLX) to their market cap on the strength of their earnings.

And this has anything to do with any of my arguments how? ''the stock went up so what you said isn't true'' Tesla went up to 410$ a share and dragged the whole market up when it did. In the dot com bubble there were tons of companies skyrocketing dragging every other company up with it too. Some of these companies are still trading below what they traded for in that bubble. But this argument has nothing to do with our conversation and is a wasted of time for me to talk about. I'm not here to discuss irrational markets.  


>CUDA is in so deep with thousands of customers and millions of developers dislodging them is not even imaginable.

They said the same about so many other things. I already named some examples in other comments here. Like Windows, MacOS and many cloud computing taks only would run on x86. It was **Intel's moat** they said. Yet here we are, Windows and MacOS run amazingly on ARM now with almost all their programs.   


And who pays those developers? These big tech companies are the ones paying for most of it. Slowly building an open source and investing in paying the developers to learn some new software is easily worth the investment for them.",2024-02-23,1
"Which means nothing if the stock drops 50% next year, just like happened to many other stocks earlier.   
Tesla was up 5-10% a day for so many days. Then out of nowhere they peaked at 410$ and dropped to 110$. Now it struggles to break 200 and is still down over 50% from it's high with no catalyst on the horizon.

&#x200B;

''Its up 6% i'm right and you are wrong'' Boy you need to study some history. We have seen thousands of stocks run up 1900% followed by a 90% drop. You're only making profits when you sell or when the company has grown it's FCF to back up the current price. Which it obviously hasn't. You keep gambling though, i'll do my thing.",2024-02-23,1

"IBMs AI is garbage. They are a marketing-driven services company in decline. I would recommend you don‚Äôt do this.

They don‚Äôt have a broad or long term strategy to improve their AI or build other innovations either. Their AI and tech are only improved if one of their non-tech customers agrees to a substantial ($10-20mm minimum) contract for a specific use case.

Notably most of these customers are the older companies in the F500. IBM does not have any growth plan other than for the oldest portion of the economy to grow. Their project minimums mean they have no substantial young, growing customers. Their lack of tech leadership means they have nothing to sell to large tech companies.

There is a reason they have been laying off <500 staff per office or department every single time they make an announcement in the news. It‚Äôs to cover up the decline. There‚Äôs a reason they don‚Äôt have a single significant data offering in the market. After running one of the largest DB businesses on the planet for years they missed the boat on doc DBs, columnar storage, vector DBs, and they‚Äôre a year behing Google Cloud at having a scalable cloud offering for RAG. ‚Ä¶unless one of their non-tech customers asks for and funds an AI  project they won‚Äôt innovate one internally. Even then IBM will likely just try to acquire a not-healthy startup or open source one. And why would one of their non-tech customers even know to ask for a vector DB or RAG option until they‚Äôre available at near-cost from OpenAI?

IBM is deep into decline. I just wish I knew what timeline to sell the puts on.

With competitors nipping at it's heels, NVDA can't afford to slow down in its current fabrication race.

Hence changes in EULA to try and deter an Oracle/Java-like CUDA undermining/breakaway.

Worse, the leap in DC capital costs and supply starvation open the door for cloud providers to siphon off margin. To compete in this arena, NVDA must add software/services/lease muscles that their cloud customers/future-competitors have had for years.  There is much prior art for electrical engineering companies trying to be software companies - it's a hard transition, YMMV for sure.",2024-03-06,3

"When talking about a single stock you really have to think what you're asking about and why NVDA's stock price is so high.

* It is very high because recent quarterly earnings have shown a massive increase in demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. 
* Based on this + how much tech is hyping AI-related shit, the Market thinks the demand will only grow.
* All it takes is for the market to get bored and plateau on AI, or for a comparable AI-chip competitor to reign in NVDA's massive profit margin.
* NVDA for now holds a pretty good monopoly on majority of AI chips just by being first to market in a certain way.
* It depends on which future you think is more probable vs your risk vs reward aversion.

It's much more probable the NVDA will drop 20% than VOO will drop 20%, but the upside of NVDA is probably higher than the short-term upside of VOO. So the question is: How much do you care if you lose the money you have in NVDA? If not a lot, you can keep it...

Notably, this contest ""aims to **generate quantum computing algorithms** that can be put into practice (today or in the future) to help achieve **societally beneficial goals**, like those described by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.""

So it is not just 'discovering a use', but a use that will benefit society as a whole, and then coming up with the algorithm to run it on a quantum computer. 

It is commonly accepted that quantum computers have the potential to speed up many computational processes, which is valuable across industries. It also makes intractable problems, tractable, without needing to rely on large assumptions. Modeling problems with large numbers of parameters will benefit significantly from quantum computing. 

Here are a few fields where this is likely to have an impact:

* Computational Biology, Biochemistry and Drug Discovery
* Climate modeling.
* Artificial intelligence and machine learning
* Logistics
* Finance (particularly algorithmic trading and optimization problems)
* Cybersecurity

"The only time to sell a company that you bought as an investment is when you find another company that you believe is a better value at the current price than the one you are holding. If you find a company that you really believe in and you think it has more growth potential at the price it is trading at, a smart investor would sell the ""overvalued"" stock and buy the undervalued one. A company is only ""overvalued"" relative to other companies, it is subjective and you have to learn how to value a company based on its fundamentals and your own opinions.

There are a lot of factors that determine when you should do this. For example, if you're not very active in the market, you should only buy companies that you are absolutely confident in holding for the long term. If you are more active, you can rebalance your portfolio more often, but there is a very fine line between trading and investing. If you're not a trader, and you don't aspire to be, you should not be moving your positions around too often.

I personally think NVDA is a great company and that it has more growth to come, but I strongly believe that you can't go wrong taking profits at these prices as long as you are moving the money into something you think is a better value. When I sell a company, I don't like to sell my entire position as it lets me keep an eye on the price and help me know when I should add to it (or sell more). I only ever buy companies in my investment account that I'm okay with holding for a long time, so this approach works well for me.

Good luck.",2024-03-08,10

"I bought like 50 shares on margin at cost basis $717 like 2 weeks ago, then it proceeded to drop to like $670... i almost shit myself and exited but good thing i waited cause it went back to $770 the next day.. ended up unloading about half of my shares at ~$800 and still have 25 shares left and out of margin. It was a gamble but i really do love the company. i have about 25 shares in my IRA with cost basis ~$200 just from the crypto boom of 2021 but i've also always been a gamer who used their GPUs... just never really put 2 and 2 together and bought their stock... I've been stocking up on AMD tho, their GPUs have been competition and their consumer processors are arguably the best so I wouldn't be surprised that they'll become the defacto #2 after NVDA.",2024-03-08,2
Buy,2024-03-08,2
You never lose money ringing the register and selling some. It‚Äôs based on your plan. Do you want to hold forever? Chop some? As an opinion you could sell 3 shares that‚Äôs close to the principal of the original investment price and let the other 12 shares go forever or at least get to $1000.,2024-03-08,2
A general recommendation is don‚Äôt let one holding become more than 10% of your portfolio. That‚Äôs just for risk mitigation as you don‚Äôt want one piece of bad news doing outsized damage to your overall portfolio.¬†,2024-03-08,2

No one can tell the future and as fast as it goes up it can drop even faster. So here‚Äôs an idea: take out $400 from your NVDA holding. Then you have realized 100% annual gain for two years. Let the rest stay with NVDA. It‚Äôs all free money!,2024-03-08,2

"I am in the same boat as you. Most of my investments are in Voo and fangs.  nvda has grown to 13% of my overall taxable holdings. I did buy it over 5 years ago and already sold my basis at around 200. So this is ‚Äúhouse money‚Äù for me. I used to look at it from position management position - don‚Äôt let an individual stock weigh more than 5% of your portfolio , I even tried to sell more at 505 , but luckily the order did not get filled . However now I froze . Holding on to it has been the best strategy so far. But those over 50% drawdowns really suck. So be ready to see a it retrace to $400 
On the other hand , If this is similar to what Tesla did in 2021 , then there is plenty of upside with p/E expanding to 200 from the current 40. If it plays out that way , the price can reach between 3K and 5K.  But this is not based on fundamentals and the market cap reaching 6 and 10 trillion seems very improbable in the medium term , but in a decade very possible.",2024-03-08,3

"I got a couple of shares right before they split in 2021, which ended me up with about 7-8 shares. I've been buying fractional shares here and there over this run up, which doesn't seem like it will have any issues in the short term (maybe the next year or two at least.)

I currently have about 10 shares, and definitely not selling. They split last time in the 700s, I think, so I've been reading rumors that they could split this year too. 

If they DO split 3 or 4 for 1, I would consider taking some profits after the price runs back up a bit post-split. Maybe pull out my initial investment, currently sitting at about $2500.

If you're not already in an S&P 500 fund, I would definitely get into that.

If you're with Fidelity, I'd check out FSELX, their Semiconductor fund. NVIDIA is around a quarter of that fund, and its been going gangbusters. I'm up almost 49% (+$1,600+) since getting into it last year.",2024-03-08,1

"The question is not wether NVDA will keep going up, because nobody knows. The question is about what level of risk you think is reasonable to take.

You would just making a decision regarding how to best use your assets. If you wouldn‚Äôt spend that amount of cash in NVIDIA, then sell it.

I for myself think it is more reasonable to hold VOO than any single stock (even though actually I don‚Äôt hold VOO specifically). So I would sell it as the more reasonable decision. If it goes up, as it will probably do, I wouldn‚Äôt beat myself over it, because I took the level of risk that was reasonable for me.",2024-03-08,1

ARM is not WeWork.

ARM's value is intellectual not physical. 

ARM tech is embedded in almost everything. ""Reach"" is multi-armed in CPU/GPU segment across a wide variety of devices and systems all seeing high growth and demand. 

Short term volatility will increase with significant risk on both the up and downside.

All dependent on the volume of unlocked shares and sold in coming weeks

Longer term the price volatility will offer long investors opportunities to accumulate. 

Conservative estimates short term 25% downside with high volatility through summer  reaching a 12 month stable price around $230 on strong earnings and demand with traders and investors.

Risks are heavy shorting, ANY miss on earnings results and the subsequent overreaction by traders.",2024-03-09,1

"That's not dilution kiddo.

Lockup expiration allows insiders to sell their shares - they may or may not sell. Depending on how long ago the shares were issued, there may be different tax implications, and it may not be beneficial to sell.

Dilution is when a company issues new permanent shares.

People selling shares of a stock is not dilution. It's just people selling shares of a stock, which happens every day. 

Keep in mind that before  lockup expiration, individuals open short positions that usually have to be covered, and lockup expiration is the best day to do it.

Their impacts on stock price from dilution and lockup expiration are nowhere near the same. Get schooled son.",2024-03-11,1

"Dilution is always priced in ? 

Whoa !!!",2024-03-11,0
What‚Äôs cost basis?,2024-03-11,1
"This is just my rationale; I'm 100% open to criticism on it, I'm by no means infallible.

For me, Jensen said it best, generative AI can take any business with a digital aspect and make its production 3-6x faster and thus more efficient. The Bears seem up in arms that NVDA is highly speculated (taking a position with substantial risk of loss or profit), but there's no competitor poised to really step in and replace Nvidia or even compete with them, really. Competition is inevitable, but replacement? No. 

While Nvidia doesn't make their own chips, who does? With 80% market share (and growing based on earnings) and companies wanting to leap ahead of competitors in a global market, no one is waiting to pull the trigger on AI, they already want it they just have difficulty getting their hands on it and supply is getting better. What other company can basically proclaim in their earnings call that every product they make this year will sell out and that their limitation will be supply? Not AMD, nor Intel.

Thinking about Microsoft (3T market cap) and Apple (2.6T market cap), Nvidia (2.2T market cap) is in a position to meet or overtake both of these because their hoppers can help‚Äîliterally‚Äîany company looking to use generative AI and they are mostly software-driven and tuned up by subscription which could be almost every company using it paying for this update-service. Nvidia going to $1,050/share would be about 2.6T market cap and $1200/share would be 3T market cap? I can see Nvidia doing a 10:1 share split and becoming part of a trifecta with Apple and Microsoft, a sort of global tech tripod, so to speak. They have carved out their market niche, they just need to keep it. That will be sured up once the U.S. starts making their own chips, relying less on TSM. I do worry about Taiwan and China getting into it a bit, but that would also screw China over to disrupt their own supply, and inspire of what many people may think. China isn't really the ""start a war"" type. I think China is more interested in maintaining its market footing and competitiveness. War screws that up. So for now I think that part looks okay.

I do worry I'm overly optimistic. That's my issue. Nvidia is over its 50-day moving average and 21-day fast moving average, but I don't think that's necessarily deserving of a drop, bears be damned.  My suspicion is that it will meet resistance around.  $1050 and $1200 to overtake Apple and Microsoft, respectively. As for when it will get there... I think the ""market"" has chosen their footing and are waiting for receipts. Vanguard and Blackrock have 8.2% and 7.2% stakes in Nvidia respectively. I feel like they are in it for a 3-5 year investment.

Ugh. Typing it all out makes me feel like I should dawn an aluminum foil hat. I have a pretty large position in Nvidia, but I'm not sentimental about it. I just look around and Nvidia looks like the best thing to invest in that I understand.",2024-03-11,1

It's a mistake to assume the market  will or should  repeat exactly the same pattern as 2000.   Also doesn't mean it's not a hype bubble right now.



> Bubbles do not occur when people claim we are in a bubble.

Not how it works.

"If you had concerns prior to the bear market beginning in 2008, congratulations, but you were in the minority. I remember hearing rumblings of real estate issues brewing in 2007 from my hedge fund buddies, but it was not before the market was already down significantly before the majority woke up to the extent of the subprime mortgage crisis.

Similarly, in 1999, there was no one talking about a bubble. It was buy buy buy, the Internet was going to change the world and the wild valuations were justified. Only in 2000 after the market was down significantly did the majority accept the insanity of that final parabolic move.

The market never repeats the same exact patterns, but often rhymes with history. All I am suggesting is that the bull market that began in 2023 has only recently reached new highs. As recently as November the bull market was on the ropes. The action since then has solidified the strength of the bull, and there is zero evidence of any bubble. Those who choose to take their money out of stocks for fear we are in a bubble are allowing their own bias to rule their decisions rather than the weight of evidence.

Being out of the market in strong bullish trends can have significant opportunity cost.",2024-03-16,1

It's gonna keep on dipping until SMCI earnings,2024-04-21,1
"It's going to push 740 by the end of the week at the very least IMO. If it breaks 740 before then, it'll flirt with 700 but not getting too close. 

Obviously it's all guesswork, but I don't see any news that would bring it back up anytime soon until after SMCI earnings. It's a fickle market, and anything can change on the smallest bit of news, but I'm not touching this until the end of the week.",2024-04-22,2
"This is the ‚ÄúCalm before storm‚Äù time

"Yup. I'm not selling until it splits and then runs up. And then I'll sell, pause and buy again.

I fully expect a 5-1 split putting the price at \~180....at which point, I expect it to run up \~20% in the next couple months or maybe even month. At that point it'll be overpriced at \~220 a share and settle back in around 200 a share. 

  
And actually...I take it back. I don't know if I'll sell at that point. I think it could easily be trading for 300 a share by this time next year.",2024-04-23,1
"I would expect it to trade sideways for the next month until they're next earnings report. I don't see it hitting 700 or close to it. I don't think it'll climb up much over 800. But there's really no reason for it to have dropped 13% in a week. Look at TSM. Great earnings, price drops.

This has less to do with NVDA and earnings(its current drop) than just the volatility baked into the market. 

If you see 750 or even 770 again, I'd be buying.",2024-04-23,2

"I‚Äôd like to start a political action committee, to get these ballot initiatives going, and to run people born after 1980 who are progressive democrats to liberal republicans.

In the 1990s I had a distant cousin who was a New England Republican? He wanted to ban assault weapons, including hand guns, and only allow bolt action rifles and side by side 12 gauge.

He was a hunter, and his idea was basically if you ‚Äúneed‚Äù a more high power weapon than soldiers had in ww2 to hunt defenseless animals; you should go to the range.

This was during the time crime was out of control, 1980s to 1990s. He had a perfect score from the EPA.

His son took his seat, did the same thing, and the gop defunded him, so he resigned, became an independent, and eventually a democrat.

We need both sides of the aisle to win, but if you think about the social media skills of Gen Y and Gen Z, with the addition of help from a PAC, that, in my mind would have a 12-15 group, a 15-17 group, 18+ but use a Wikipedia style policy generation engine, and get stuff on the ballot, and try to change the country by ballot initiates and social media.

I think lawmakers, federal and state, should put money in a blind trust, same with governors, a binding one on the president, judges and scotus, they should have a conflict of interest between justice, representing the American people, and their portfolio.

If you look at what the average law makers net worth is, compared to their salary, they‚Äôre usually filthy rich.

So are they working for you and I? Or do they work for the companies, lobbiests, etc.

Even non binding stuff like asking scoutus to revisit corporate personhood and money as free speech, citizens united, etc.

I mean if the American people can change things at the ballot, it‚Äôd break the gridlock in dc, and the way the government is paralyzed by partisan politics.

It‚Äôs also time to ‚Äúpass the torch‚Äù ‚Äúto a new generation of Americans‚Äù. -jfk

‚ÄúBe the change you want to see in the world‚Äù - Obama.

Let‚Äôs also get hedge funds and equity out of 1-4 unit homes; limit the number of 1-4 unit homes to a certain amount, and come up with reasonable limits on short term rentals.

Let‚Äôs make America affordable again, bring back the American dream.

You do realize that it's far easier for individuals with a few hundred thousand/million net worth to increase their value than hedge funds with billions or tens of billions right?

A lot of people weren't sure it was going to keep going up.

[You can use this calculator, and see they are underperforming the stock market.](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)

It isn't interesting, you're either doing exactly what I said, or you're being obtuse.  Stop breaking your arm jerking yourself off to defend a horrid politician.

"But when you maintain such a singular focus, people automatically assume the problem is limited to one person.

If you restricted the debate about corrupt police to *one cop*, after a while people just assume the problem can be solved by dealing with that one guy.

And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here. You and I are probably largely in agreement with regard to a solution. But if you genuinely want this to change and you think posting things here will move the needle even a tiny bit, this lopsided focus on Nancy Pelosi will backfire. 

There are tens of thousands of other people legally trading on insider information every day. Let‚Äôs be outraged about some of them for a change.",2024-05-29,0

"That could perhaps be true for issues not related to extremely singular individuals and institutions.  The police are a massive institution with nearly a million people involved.  On the other hand, a person could memorize the names of everyone in congress.

We are outraged about others, of course we are.  But when you dilute an issue to ""so many fucking people do it"" from ""the most powerful person in congress does it and supports it"" you lose a bit of the messaging impact, wouldn't you think?

This focus on Pelosi won't backfire, because she (and they) don't care about your opinion on the matter.  And she doesn't have to, she's one of the richest and most powerful people in the world.  But you're right it's messaging.",2024-05-29,1

"The DAX german index is around 15 PE. Applying that multiple to the German stock index of 2.5T and comparing it to NVDA at 2.7T, NVDA trades at around 40x forward earnings, the DAX at around 13x. Not saying 40 vs 13 isn‚Äôt a big gap, but honestly NVDA is growing faster than any german company and especially larger than the group.

Put simply, NVDA is already earning about 1/4th the amount of all public german companies combined. And beats their growth rate by ~5-10x.

You can‚Äôt just take platitudes as fact. Sure it seems ridiculous that NVDA exceeds Germany‚Äôs total market value, but it‚Äôs not even the only company close to this. What matters is only earnings and growth.

So if your thesis here is that stagflation will eventually force higher rates and push down NVDA stock price, that really would only reasonably be 1-3 years out from now, if it happens.

Once chatgpt became a reality, it showed consumer AI was the next big thing. Besides the models, the number 1 infrastructure backing AI that people could invest in was graphics card makers. There are only two major ones and Nvidia was ahead and more focused on AI than AMD. Chip makers spend billions in investments and there won't be any new chip makers popping up, there was only two choices. This is how investors think. They are looking to invest in the shovel makers during a gold rush 

This exact thing happened with Cisco and network equipment during the Internet boom during the 90s . Go look at a Cisco chart between 1992-2000

"sometimes it's necessary to get where you wanted. when I lost my job and started my own business i worked 14 hour days at least for a good stretch. i needed to do it to survive and to accomplish my goals. i am 100% confident the business would not have succeeded if I didnt work that much for a sustained period of time. even working like that it took at least 6 months to get my first paying customer.

i dont regret it one bit and i would happily do it again. if you have big dreams like a lot of very succesful people did, its extremely difficult if not sometimes impossible to accomplish it working 6-8 hours a day or whatever people think is ideal. the simple fact is its note enough time.

many celebrities, entrepeneurs, ceos, singers, athletes work way more this because thats the bottom line. your comepititon might be getting up at 4am and spending 3-4 more hours or more than you a day. if youre both equally smart you are NOT going to win working less than half of other people who are desperate to beat you.

well it might be toxic and unstable, to do amaazing huge things, you have to work crazy hours. you think the team who was responsible for like the moon landing said okay we are gonna do a 30 hour work week for better balance. no they obessed about every detail all day every day for years. you cant have balance in a lot of cases to do something that no one has done before, or even to do something that some people have done but they worked incredibly hard for.

your never gonna be at the top of your game, whatever it is, working less than your competition unless you were just naturally gifted. why do you think everyone at the top of their fields practices an insane amount?

some violinists practice over 10 hours a day which is absolute insanity... you think they are gonna be better than some virtuoso if that's their goal by doing 1 or 2? same for any field. its simply not possible to work a small amount and accomplish anything huge unless you win a lottery ticket.

yes if you want a simple roof over your head, food and maybe some small luxuries and to work for someone else and call it a day, you can probably find better balance. if you have big dreams, youre gonna have to work like crazy and grind.

in any field, if i told one of the top people in it i wanted to do the same, they would all say it could be possible but youre going to have to work like crazy.",2024-06-09,4

"My dad was the CEO of a very large chain of restaurants that he sold, and then another very large chain that he took public. 

If you asked him how many days he worked, the answer was legit 7 days a week. But it‚Äôs not 7 8 hour days. It‚Äôs like M-F wake up at 6, do your morning routine and down in the kitchen by 7. Answer emails from 7-8, drive into the office, work until about 6pmish, home at 7. Do that 5 days a week. Then on the weekend still wake up at 7, same morning routine, answer emails/go over numbers from 8-10/11, and then enjoy your weekend. Answer emails from about 9-10pm right before bed. 

So if you asked him he worked 7 days a week, but it wasn‚Äôt really 7 days of like 11 hour days. Which is probably the case for the CEO of Nvidia. As the CEO you‚Äôre not doing menial day to day stuff, you‚Äôre answering emails and coming up with corporate strategy and overall direction. 

You‚Äôre ‚Äúthinking about work‚Äù all the time because you‚Äôre kicking around ideas in your head constantly, just like how you kick around ideas constantly when you‚Äôre planning your deck build, even though you‚Äôre not actively building your deck at that moment.

"In theory TSLA is more than one application.

I don't own the stock and I hate elon but I see:

1. as proven with the Supercharger network, there's value in licensing the design innovations, such as the CAN BUS wiring design. And the use of 48V architecture is another innovation and tesla has shared that with the automotive industry to move the innovation along to general acceptance (just as the proprietary charging system has become the North American standard.) 

2. there is thought, floated by elon (so could be completely crazy), that the computers in the cars could be used as a source of distributed compute power. I see a ton of issues with this but it is an interesting idea. Currently there are millions of tesla computers connected to the mother ship and when the car is not in use, that power is just sitting there, unused. 

3. I believe optimus prime robot is produced through tesla and not a spin-off. I am suspect of elon's hype about things (it makes me literally sick and can trigger a rage in me) but in the past, a half or full decade after elon has declared ""by the end of the year"" his vision makes it to market and the rest of the industry seems to have sat out waiting for elon to be proven wrong rather than move forward while elon is BSing. So the market advantage ends up being tesla's. With the shortage of workers and in the increase of AI to simulate a caring person, I can see humanoid robots actually becoming a decent sized market. 

The problem is whether the market sees TSLA as a car company (if so, it is insanely overpriced) or as a bleeding edge tech company steered by a visionary genius A-hole with a number of incredible successes. Many journalists who have covered elon in the past are noting a distinct change since Covid  in his already warped personality so they are concerned one needs consider whether past successes are indications of future successes due to the personality change.",2024-06-15,1

At which point, something new emerges (an expanded perspective at the species level) that no longer requires that suffering in order to continue the development of society. Suffering is simply the current mechanism by which information gets scattered, necessitating a reintegration, by which complexity increases. This has been the mode for pretty much all biological organisms. This is the entire purpose of our various systems of physical and emotional pain. It leads to greater complexity and more developed forms of consciousness. It is a more reactive system and hopefully we get to the point where we consciously disintegrate dying systems as we integrate in new systems instead of allowing them to crumble and fall, often leading to widespread hardship.",2024-06-16,2

There are a lot of ways to use AI. 

In broad IT terms, there‚Äôs 3 primary delivery models. SaaS, PaaS and IaaS all come with different advantages, and disadvantages. (Software, Platform, Infastructure)

SaaS is pre-packaged applications made for a specific purpose. IaaS is much more customizable, but requires a lot expertise and/or time to do what you want to. 

LLM‚Äôs and generative AI are fairly new. And working with it is kind of like riding a bike. It takes time, and reps. There‚Äôs not a whole lot of true GenAI experts out there, and the ones that are, have been working with or following closely with it for a while. 

We‚Äôre at a situation where things are probably at a bit of a crux with technology and skilling. 

The smart data analysts, and other IT people are aggressively learning and upskilling in AI, but we‚Äôre not quite there yet. 

Likewise, the main LLM for GPT may not be specialized enough for every use case or purpose, so people are considering/or doing their own LLM, which is expensive, or looking at LLMaaS offerings where they can create an ultra specific LLM to accomplish the task/automation they want. 

Now, back to the easy wins thing‚Ä¶technology leaders typically answer to a CFO/and/or board of directors. These people range on how supportive they are on blowing money on AI, so typically a company starts with easy wins to build momentum and confidence, with hopes of getting some great AI ROI on real things in the business. 

Examples: tools like Gemini, Microsoft 365 Copilot, LLM backed chatbots, or maybe some advanced optical character recognition and automation that isn‚Äôt going to be crazy expensive for the org to invest in, but still gives time/productivity back as a multiple. 


The reason GPT 4o being half price was such a big deal is because API calls on GPT are expensive. As the price comes down, more and more people will utilize it more and more. 

As technology leaders get the bean counters to spend their monies, we‚Äôll see things ramp. 

Also, to use a simple example, when Pepsi is on the news about their shiny new AI app that‚Äôs going to save them a billion dollars, you can bet your ass Coke is going to invest as much as they can to get a competitive edge. Now expand this across tens of thousands of competing businesses worldwide. The FOMO is real. Hence why companies are starting AI steering committees, even when they aren‚Äôt heavy investors yet.",2024-06-17,2

"Not to mention that ""MADE 5 MILLION!!!"" is absolute pennies compared to say...Musk making FIFTY BILLION off a pay package where he ran the biggest stock hustle off bogus numbers, staged product demos, and rigged financial projections. More money than anyone in human history, but haven't seen a single thread about that in this sub.

Pelosi's husband also, on top of being an investor, started with a big trust fund he inherited from his dad. Their gains are small and slow compared to modern CEOs and mega-corp stock awards.

It's obviously too hard for jealous poor lemmings with retard brains to say things like ""hey we  should tax rich people"" rather than ""progressive policies are evil because Pelosi, therefor these regressive politicians are better"" tard shit.",2024-06-19,1

"If we look at their revenue and benefit, we logicallly conclude that they are at bubble price and far too expensive by a factor of 2-3X. At this point people don't try to buy NVDA because they really think the fundamentals of the company make sense but just because they heard they make lot of money and must continue because of AI.

It is very similar to the 2001 bubble. People went crazy, bet all that internet would develop at incredible rate. They were even right. But right too fast and too early. And many of the companies that did benefit most were not even existing or public. You could not invest in Google or Meta/Facebook for example.

Most of the startups went bankrupt or it took them 10 more years to start make that much.

Cisco did like Nvidia, biggest company in the world, shortly. Their gone up to 80$ per share. After the crash it was 13$ per share. And now 23 years later it is 45$ per share.

Making huge money from selling stuff doesn't mean you make infinite money, it doesn't mean it last, it doesn't mean there will be no competition. Right now Nvidia doesn't sell enough to justify it price. It sell at more than 70 years of revenue. And people expect they will sell much more every year and that there will no competition and that sales will not drop when everybody has brought their chip already.

For now the real problem with AI is that everybody invest hundred of billions combined but that in term of revenue, companies make only a few billion more... It will not last forever.

Either everybody will start to pay big money for AI assistants and alike or the bubble will pop. So ask your grand ma and your spouse as well as your kids if they all already to pay 10-25$ a month for an AI assistant.",2024-06-20,1

"I don't know for GameStop but the big increase in values is behind for NVDA and even bitcoin. I mean bitcoin might increase a lot in value but you are not going to get the same return as we got the last past 10 years. And NVDA is now at bubble prices.

Last time we had equivalent stuff was Cisco with the internet bubble. People were sure the company would go to the moon building network equipment.  Cisco went to up to 80$ per share in 2001. After the crash it went at low as 13$ and now 23 years later it is worth 45$. People that brought it as such valuations didn't recoup their loss yet.

Honestly it could be the same for NVDA. If you brought more than 1 year ago, just sell right NOW and pocket huge benefits.

 If you plan to buy right now, just don't do it. NVDA is extremely over priced and trade at more than 70 time its yearly revenue. It is insane and there 0 chance it will do again a 10X performance in the short term to go from 3 trillions $ to 30 trillion and be valued more than US GDP.

Buy a broad market index in that case like SP500. There already 7.25% of NVDA in it, and overall about 1/3 of it is tech stock. This alone is already a bubble if you ask me. But I am sure SP500 would manage to recoup in the long run. Even if there a crash and it lose 30-40% it will bounce and 20 year later it will not mater 1 bit.

NVDA might never make it back to such value or take 20-30 years+, a bit like Cisco.",2024-06-20,1

Do you know how rebalancing and ETFs work? For example 6 months ago I might have an ETF where Nvidia was 10% of the holdings, based on the recent run up it now might make up 40% or more of the holdings.

Yes of course you rebalance. People who bought into the ETF are not buying a 40% Nvidia etf, they are buying the etf you originally designed.

And putting a player on the bench is an awful analogy. Benching a player has no upside, banking profits from a recent run and redistributing to others with more potential upside (and much less risk of downside) is a sensible play.

Based on your logic you‚Äôd never go an etf, it‚Äôs 100% all in on one stock.
